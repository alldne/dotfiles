# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.
matches:
  - trigger: ";date"
    replace: "{{mydate}}"
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y-%m-%d"

  - trigger: ";week"
    replace: "Week of {{monday}}"
    vars:
      - name: monday
        type: shell
        params:
          cmd: "date -v -Mon '+%Y-%m-%d'"

  - trigger: ";wip"
    replace: "{{branch}}"
    vars:
      - name: branch
        type: shell
        params:
          # Your working git path
          cmd: "cd $WIP_DIR; git branch --show-current"
