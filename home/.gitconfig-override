# This file is guaranteed to be loaded after .gitconfig is completely loaded.
#
# Why is this needed? Because the order in the .gitconfig matters.
# For instance, `git config --global user.name` appends lines at the end of the .gitconfig,
# which could potentially overwrite user.name and user.email set in the .gitconfig.
